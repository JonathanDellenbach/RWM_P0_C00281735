* Upon one merge conflict regarding the demo.txt my lines at one point looked like:
Line 1 (B)
Line 1 (A)
Line 2

I realized it was replicated code so through the merging tool I put them together resulting in:

Line 1 (A) (B)
Line 2


* Similarly in Button.svelte there was slight differences in the styling of the button and with use of
the VSCode merge tool or meld it simplified the usage of fixing merge conflicts and making it easier
to read the side by side comparison. 

* On branch A the button was more console focused whereas branch B is a bit more interactive
so once again using the merge tools I did a side by side comparison allowing me to make a decsion
and ended up choosing B as it would of been a more interactive experience for a user.
